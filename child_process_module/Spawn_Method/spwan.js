By default, the spawn function does not create a shell to execute the command we pass into it.

The spawn function is a much better choice when the size of the data expected from the command is large,

spawned child process inherit the standard IO objects of its parents if we want to
we can make the spawn function use the shell syntax as well
Shell - boolean value , if true run command inside shell
uid - user identity of process
gid- group identity of process
detached - boolean , make child process independent of it's parent
stdio- child stdio configuration ,pipe,ignore or inherit(all about stream getting for output, inherit means from pararent)
stdio:['ignore',outputFile, err] - we can set array value for stdio and  first element for stdin, second for stdout, third for stderr
env - environement key-value paire
cwd - current working directory of child process
