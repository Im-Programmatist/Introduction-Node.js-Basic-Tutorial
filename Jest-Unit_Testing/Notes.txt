There are three main methods in this test file:

describe() – It is a suite of Test scripts that gives an outer description for the test suite
test() – It is the smallest unit test case that is written to be executed. String in quotes represents the test name
expect() – It is an assertion. Every test() statement has an expect() function which takes a value and expects a return in true form.
